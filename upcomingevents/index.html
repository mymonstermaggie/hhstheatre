            <h2>Mondays Always Leads to Murder</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Mr. Monday, I want you to find this artifact," purrs sultry client Courtney Delecroix. "It's a choker worn by King Midas." Harry Monday sizes her up and asks, "You want me to find the Midas Muffler?" And once again, that cliché in a trenchcoat and fedora is off on another case, one which has him trying to solve a 20-year-old murder mystery and write a play about his career at the same time. Harry soon finds himself, as usual, way over his head as chaos swirls around him—a mousy little woman wants Harry to take on a case for her and then officer Brogan rushes in and arrests her; an actor starts masquerading as Harry; a janitor shows up at all the right (or wrong) times; and the curse of a missing gem appears. But our man Harry manages to wisecrack his way through yet another fast-paced, clue-strewn mystery.</p>

            <h2>Shrek</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Set in a mythical “once upon a time” sort of land, Shrek the Musical is the story of a hulking green ogre who, after being mocked and feared his entire life by anything that crosses his path, retreats to an ugly green swamp to exist in happy isolation. Suddenly, a gang of homeless fairy-tale characters (Pinocchio, Cinderella, the Three Pigs, you name it) raid his sanctuary, saying they’ve been evicted by the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad. So Shrek strikes a deal: I’ll get your homes back, if you give me my home back! But when Shrek and Farquaad meet, the Lord strikes a deal of his own: He’ll give the fairy-tale characters their homes back, if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona. Shrek obliges, yet finds something appealing–something strange and different–about this pretty princess. He likes her. A lot. But why does she always run off when the sun sets?</p>

            <h2>Leading Ladies</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In this hilarious comedy two English Shakespearean actors, Jack and Leo, find themselves so down on their luck that they are performing "Scenes from Shakespeare" on the Moose Lodge circuit in the Amish country of Pennsylvania. When they hear that an old lady in York, PA is about to die and leave her fortune to her two long lost English nephews, they resolve to pass themselves off as her beloved relatives and get the cash. The trouble is, when they get to York, they find out that the relatives aren't nephews, but nieces! Romantic entanglements abound, especially when Leo falls head-over-petticoat in love with the old lady's vivacious niece, Meg, who's engaged to the local minister. Meg knows that there's a wide world out there, but it's not until she meets "Maxine and Stephanie" that she finally gets a taste of it.</p>
